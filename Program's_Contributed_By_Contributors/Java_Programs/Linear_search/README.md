Linear search is the easiest searching algorithm it takes the key to be searched and iterates throughout the array, if key element is found it returns its position.<br>
# Best Case Complexity
In the best-case scenario, the linear search algorithm performs O(1) operations.<br>
Key element found in first position.
# Worst Case Complexity
In the worst-case scenario, the linear search algorithm performs O(n) operations.<br>
Key element may be in last position or not at all.
# Average Case Complexity
In the average case of the Linear Search Algorithm is O(n).<br>
Key element found at middle position of the array.
# Space Complexity
Since the algorithm is not creating sub array, Space Complexity of linear search is O(n) for an array of n numbers.
