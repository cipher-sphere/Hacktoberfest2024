# Contribution rules📚

- The project must work when opening Contributors.html
- You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just merge it ;)
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site)
- Do NOT remove other content.
- Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works
- Add your name to the Contributors.html file
- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts
