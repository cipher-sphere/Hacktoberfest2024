<h1>QR CODE GENERATOR</h1>
<p>Free Online QR Code Generator to make your own QR Codes. Supports Dynamic Codes, Tracking, Analytics, Free text, vCards and more.</p>
<h2>Endless lifetime with unlimited scans</h2>

<p>QRCode Monkey also has no limitations. All generated QR codes will work forever, do not expire and have no scanning limits like you see at other commercial QR code generators. The created QR codes are static so the only limitation is that you can't edit the QR code again.</p>

<h2>QR Codes with Logo</h2>

<p>Put a custom brand on your QR code. With QRCode Monkey it is very simple and straightforward to add a logo to your QR Code. The QR codes are still readable. Every QR code can have an error correction up to 30%. This means 30% of the QR code (excluding the corner elements) can be removed and the QR code is still working. We can put a logo image on the QR code that covers up to 30%.</p>

<h2>Custom Design and Colors</h2>

<p>Make your QR code look really unique with our design and color options. You can customize the shape and form of the corner elements and the body of the QR code. You can also set your own colors for all QR code elements. Add a gradient color to the QR code body and make it really stand out. Attractive QR codes can increase the amount of scans.</p>
