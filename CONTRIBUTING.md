# Contribution Guidelines ðŸ“š

Welcome to our project! We're thrilled you're interested in contributing. These guidelines will help ensure a smooth and enjoyable collaboration process.

## Core Principles:

- **Embrace Creativity:** We encourage innovative ideas! Don't hesitate to submit pull requests that challenge conventionsâ€”we might just merge them.
- **Simplicity First:** Maintain our static site simplicity by avoiding additional build steps like `npm install`.
- **Respect Existing Work:** Please add to, rather than remove, existing content.
- **Code Diversity:** Whether your code is elegant or quirky, neat or complex, if it works, we're interested!
- **Leave Your Mark:** Don't forget to add your name to the `contributorsList` file.
- **Bite-sized Contributions:** Smaller pull requests are easier to review and less likely to cause conflicts.

## Staying in Sync {Avoiding Conflicts}

Keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository to minimize conflicts:

1. **Add the Upstream Remote:**

   git remote add upstream https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2024.git
   ```

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout master
   git merge upstream/master
   ```

4. **Stay Current:**
   - Regularly sync your fork to incorporate the latest changes from the main repository.

## Best Practices

- **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your contribution works as expected before submitting.
- **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation if your changes affect project usage.
- **Be Responsive:** Keep an eye on your pull request for any feedback or questions.
